#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development, design, testing, maintenance and management of high-quality software systems.
Software engineering is important, in that, it enables the creation of reliable, scalable and innovative software needs, applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, such as communication and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. The birth of software engineering: In 1968, the NATO Software Engineering Conference officially introduced the term "software engineering" to address software crisis, a period marked by cost overruns, delays and low quality software.
2. The rise of structured programming(1970s-1980s): Early software was often written in an unstructured way, making it hard to maintain. The introduction of structured programming brought concepts like modularity, loops and conditionals, making software more readable and maintainable. There was also the development of programming paradigms like object-oriented programming(OOP), which improved software design and reusability.
3. The agile revolution: In 2001, a group of developers introduced the Agile Manifesto, promoting flexibility and customer collaboration.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Requirements: Gathering and analyzing/documenting user needs to create detailed software applications.
2. Design:Creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation: Writing the actual code based on the design.
4. Testing: Evaluating the software for bugs, security vulnerabilities and performance issues to ensure quality.
5. Deployment: Releasing the software for use.
6. Maintenance: Updating and improving the software based on user feedback, bug fixes and new feature requirements to ensure long-term functionality.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall Methodology: Have a linear and sequential approach. They are rigid, changes are difficult once a phase is completed. Have defined phases (requirements, design, coding, testing, deployment). It is best for structured, predictable projects, for example, banking and financial systems
Agile Methodology: Have an iterative and incremental approach. They are highly flexible and allow changes at any stage. Have continuous development and testing cycles. It is best for dynamic, evolving projects such as software startups and web applications.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer: Writes, tests and maintains software applications
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software meets quality standards before deployment. They design and execute test cases.
Project Manager: Oversees the software development process to ensure timely delivery. They define project scope, goals and timelines.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments: Have code efficiency and productivity, debugging and error detection, project management and integration with tools. Examples include Visual Studio, Eclipse and JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA.
Version Control Systems: Allow collaboration, change tracking (Keeps a history of code changes), developers can work on separate branches and match code when ready, and  have backup and recovery to prevent data loss. Examples include Git, Apache Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Changing requirements: Requirements may change leading to project delays in development stage
Tight deadlines: They may create pressure which may lead to compromised quality because of the rush
Technical debt: Can increase maintenance costs or intefere with future development efforts.
Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, prioritization of tasks, agile methodologies and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit: Involve testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration: Test interactions between different components or subsytems.
Acceptance: Test the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
They help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining input prompts to optimize responses from AI models.
It enhances accuracy and relevance, optimizes efficiency, improves AI adaptability, enable customization, facilitates complex problem solving and boosts productivity.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

An example of a vague prompt is "Describe a python"
Improved prompt: "Describe python in software engineering in terms of its key features and why it is commonly used in web development"
The improved prompt clearly defines the topic, so as to know what to focus on, provides context and sets a purpose.
